# Used-Car-prediction
The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, so as to create knowing purchases. In this project, We have  experiment with a real world dataset, data have been collected from varied sources and   distributed across varied locations in India. We have explore machine learning and gain information regarding different Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Algorithm.  After performing the required tasks on a dataset, it has been seen that Random Forest Algorithm yields better results than Linear Regression Algorithm.
